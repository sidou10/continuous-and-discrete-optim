# Continuous and Discrete Optimization
Continuous optimization:
- Gradient descent
- Quasi-Newton
- Penalization
- Dual method (Uzawa Algorithm)
- Simmulated annealing

Discrete optimization:
- Assignment problem
- Minimum spanning tree
- Multiobjective optimization (Pareto-optimality)
- Linear programming
